# Sistemi_Operativi_Project
#Progetto SO(made with IDLE Clion into a Linux environment-the testing process is made by Ubuntu bash):  The main goal of this project is to build an application client-server with program language C. It is able to interchange secure information, through a reliable transfer which used the transfer protocol TCP. The communication of clients with the server takes place through API Berkeley's socket. In this application I should develop a system of booking of a cinema room. I've made a server multithread, which is able to respond to clients requests at the same time. Here after establishing a stable connection: -I should return the map of avaiable place -send to the server place which I would like to book with a unique code of response which let me to cancel a reservation -cancel a reservation -lose of the connection The way to build the map is a linked list, which let me to reognised row and column. The way to make persistent the system is to use of the file.
